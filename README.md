# transportation-on-inequality
**Project Description**

Although the topic of sustainability has been on the rise in recent years, the general discussion of sustainable transportation is much less developed. As sustainable transportation, and shared transportation in particular, is a topic I'm interested in learning about, I've decided to take the time to combine this interest with my newfound python prowess. Tangible data on the effects of sustainable transportation is not prevalent, so hopefully this small project can at least add a blip to the fledgling amount of research.

I wanted to look at how investment in public transportation affects the economy in terms of individual income. To do this, I've focused specifically on Washington D.C. This is a city that has recently, in 1991, installed the Metro Green Line to Anacostia, one poorest (and therefore most transit-dependent) areas of the city. I originally wanted to compare the income levels of Anacostia to the neighborhoods across the Anacostia river, which are known to be more affluent, before and after the Green Line was built. I unfortunately couldn't find data specific to neighborhoods in the city, so I had to settle for data of the city as a whole. This naturally creates much less conclusive results. As an attempt to control for some external factors, I've included income of the U.S. for comparison.

tl;dr: I looked at income trends in Washington D.C. before and after a major Metro line connecting a poorer neighborhood to the rest of the city was built. Income data of the U.S. was added as a comparison.
